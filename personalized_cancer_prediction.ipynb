However, whether the major mechanism underlying the p53-dependent apoptosis is transactivation dependent or independent remains unclear. Using 179 mutant p53s with diverse transcriptional activities for distinct p53-binding sequences in yeast, we evaluated both their sequence-specific transcriptional activities on six p53 target genes and their ability to induce apoptosis in Saos-2 cells. These mutant p53s also represented diversity in their ability to both transactivate target genes and induce apoptosis. We identified 17 mutant p53s with superior ability to induce apoptosis than wild-type p53 that tend to cluster at residues 121 or 290 to 292. There was no significant correlation between the two functional properties on any single target gene examined. Furthermore, the 17 mutant p53s were not classified in a specific cluster by hierarchical cluster analysis on their diverse transcriptional activities, indicating that these mutant p53s were not similar in the transcriptional activity of downstream genes. These results suggested that transactivation-dependent apoptosis does not always play a major role in p53-dependent apoptosis, indirectly supporting the importance role of the transactivation-independent mechanism.  Introduction  Tumor suppressor p53 protein is a 393-amino-acid transcription factor. It is activated by a variety of cellular stresses including DNA damage and hypoxia and is phosphorylated and acetylated after translation (reviewed in refs. 1\\u20134 ). The activated p53 binds to the specific DNA sequences in the regulatory region of downstream genes, resulting in cellular events including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus far, several downstream genes have been isolated. These contain a series of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, angiogenesis, and the regulation of p53 stability. Loss of p53 function, therefore, fails to activate these genes after cellular stress and is thought to be a critical cause of tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression.  Approximately 50% of tumors contained the TP53 mutation (5, 6) and the published mutations have been summarized in the TP53 mutation databases (7, 8) , which contain more than 15,000 mutations. According to the databases, 74% were missense mutations. Thus far, 1,200 distinct missense mutations have been reported and there are mutation hotspots at residues R175, G245, R248, R249, R273, and R282. Because the common mutant p53s abrogate both the ability to transactivate downstream genes and induce apoptosis, it was concluded at the early stage of p53 studies that sequence-specific transactivation is essential for p53-dependent apoptosis. In other words, sequence-specific transactivation by activated p53 is thought to be one of the most important tumor-suppressive mechanisms in human tumorigenesis. Although many previous studies have supported the hypothesis that p53-dependent cell cycle control depends on the transactivation of specific genes (e.g., p21WAF1), the precise mechanism underlying the control of p53-dependent apoptosis is still unclear.  Transactivation-independent tumor suppression and apoptosis induction have been reported from several laboratories (9\\u201313) . Since then, accumulating experimental evidence has indicated that there is at least a cytoplasmic p53 function (14) other than the known nuclear p53 function for p53-dependent apoptosis, and the cytoplasmic p53 modulates the localization of death receptors (15) or is localized in mitochondria (16), modulating BH3 family proapoptotic proteins including Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl (17\\u201321) . Because at least some of the common mutant p53s are also inactive in transactivation-independent apoptosis, it remains unclear whether the transactivation-independent pathway can solely induce apoptosis without the transactivation pathway, or vice versa (18).  Recently, we constructed a yeast-based functional assay to construct, express, and evaluate 2,314 mutant p53s representing all possible amino acid substitutions caused by a point mutation throughout the protein (5.9 substitutions per residue; ref. 22). We showed the interrelation among the p53 structure, function, and tumor-derived mutations. The library was a precious resource for the isolation of several temperature-sensitive mutant p53s (23) and second-site suppressor mutations. 1 We also showed that there are 635 mutant p53s with either increased activity for specific target gene(s) or decreased activity for a limited number of target gene(s), whereas the remaining \\u223c1,700 mutant p53s showed either wild-type activity or no activity for all the examined target genes. We defined the former subclass as \\u201cdiverse\\u201d mutant p53s because of the diverse transcriptional activity for distinct p53 target genes. Those mutant p53s contained the R175P mutant, a rare and weak-tumorigenic mutant p53 that retained cell cycle arrest but abrogated apoptosis induction probably depending on its diverse transactivation of target genes (24\\u201326) . From the results of the R175P studies, we hypothesized that if the cellular response (cell cycle arrest and apoptosis) depends on the group of p53 target genes transactivated, the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis differs among mutant p53s and should correlate with a transactivation profile of the specific p53 target genes. To examine this hypothesis, we randomly selected 179 (\\u223c30%) of such mutant p53s, expressed them in Saos-2 cells, and evaluated their sequence-specific transcriptional activities on six p53 target genes (p21WAF1, BAX, MDM2, 14-3-3\\u03c3, p53AIP1, and PUMA) and their ability to induce apoptosis. As expected, there was diversity in their ability to induce apoptosis. We identified 17 mutant p53s with more potent apoptotic activity than that of wild-type p53, and some had comparable ability to S121F mutant p53, previously reported as \\u201csuper\\u201d p53 mutant (27). There was no significant correlation between the ability to induce apoptosis and the transcriptional activity on any single target gene examined and there was no common target gene responsible for their superior ability to induce apoptosis. Combining these results with previous reports, we find at least three possible explanations: (a) the induction of apoptosis by p53 does not always depend on any single p53-downstream gene and requires harmonized transcriptional up- and/or down-regulation of p53 target genes, (b) in some cases, interaction of other proteins with p53 may affect p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis in the series of mutant p53s, or (c) transactivation-independent apoptosis is more important than transactivation-dependent apoptosis in p53-dependent apoptosis. Additional experiments are necessary to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying p53-dependent apoptosis.  Materials and Methods  Cell Culture. Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS at 37\\u00b0C. For cell cycle analysis, immunoblot analysis, and cell proliferation assay, 1.5 \\u00d7 105 cells were seeded in a 35-mm plate (Corning, Corning, NY) and were incubated for 24 hours until 500 ng of each p53 expression vector was introduced by lipofection using an Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hercules, CA). The efficiency of the transient transfection was evaluated by counting at least 300 cells for 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining in each of six independent cultures using a \\u03b2-galactosidase expression vector, pCAGGS-lacZ (28). The average fraction of the X-gal staining cells (mean \\u00b1 SD) was 51.16 \\u00b1 1.42%, confirming high efficiency and small SD of the assay. In the cell proliferation assay, the viable cells were counted by the 0.5% trypan blue dye exclusion method at the first, second, or third day after lipofection.  Plasmid Construction. The wild-type p53 expression vector, pCR259-p53WT, and some of the mutant p53 expression vectors, pCR259-p53MTs, were constructed previously (22, 23) . Most of the pCR259-p53MTs were newly constructed in this study, and the TP53 cDNA of the pCR259-p53MTs were sequenced using a dye terminator cycle DNA sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and an automated CEQ2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). The quantity and quality of the plasmids were confirmed by spectrometry and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis before lipofection.  Fluorescence-Activated Cell-Sorting Analysis. Five hundred nanograms of pCR259-p53WT or each of the pCR259-p53MTs was introduced into the Saos-2 cells (1.5 \\u00d7 105 cells) by lipofection. After 72 hours incubation, the cells were treated with trypsin and fixed with 70% ethanol in PBS overnight. The cells were then washed once with PBS, incubated in the presence of RNase A (0.25 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 37\\u00b0C, collected by centrifugation at 200 \\u00d7 g for 5 minutes, and stained with propidium iodide (50 \\u03bcL/mL). The cells were filtered through a 50-\\u03bcm pore size nylon mesh and analyzed for cell cycle in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS, Beckman Coulter). The ability to induce apoptosis was estimated by \\u0394subG1 value that was obtained by subtracting the value of the subG1 fraction of mock lipofection from the value of the subG1 fraction of each p53 expression vector.  Immunoblot Analysis. Cells expressing p53 were washed twice with PBS, scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 \\u03bcmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 \\u03bcmol/L leupeptin, 0.5 mmol/L benzamidine, 1 \\u03bcmol/L pepstatin) and centrifuged at 15,000 \\u00d7 g for 10 minutes to remove the debris. The supernatant was retrieved as a protein lysate and separated on SDS-10% PAGE. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the p53 proteins were detected using a polyclonal anti-p53 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (FL393: sc-6243 HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).  Luciferase Assay. Reporter plasmids, p21s-luc, pMDM2s-luc, pBAXs-luc, and pSIGMAs-luc were described previously (29). Reporter plasmid pAIP1s-luc was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment containing the p53AIP1 promoter (GenBank accession no. AP000920, nucleotides 104403-105010) into the EcoRI site of pGL-Basic in this study. Reporter plasmid Frag1 contains the PUMA promoter (30). When the Saos-2 cells reached about 60% to 80% confluence in 96-well plates (Corning), pCR259-p53WT or pCR259-p53MT (12.5 ng) and one of the six luciferase reporter plasmids (87.5 ng) were cotransfected into the cells by lipofection. After 24 hours, luciferase activity was measured using a Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The mean value of three independent experiments was calculated and was evaluated by the relative value for wild-type p53.  Definition of Diverse Mutant p53. The transcriptional activity of each mutant p53 in yeast cells for eight target genes was quantitatively evaluated by their fluorescence intensity for p53-dependent fluorescent protein expression (22). In this study, we defined diverse mutant p53 when the transcriptional activity of a mutant p53 on \\u22651 but <8 distinct p53 binding sequences was 1.5-fold higher than that of wild-type p53, or 0.67-fold lower than that of the wild-type; more than 600 mutant p53s were eligible and 179 mutant p53s were randomly selected among these mutant p53s.  Hierarchical Clustering. The relative transcriptional activity of each mutant p53 in human cells was depicted as a color gradation from red (high) to green (low) depending on the level of transcriptional activity using the TIGR MeV2.2 program. The transcriptional activities of 185 mutant p53s, wild-type p53, and null p53 on the distinct p53 target genes were analyzed by hierarchical clustering method using the Cluster and Tree View programs and contrasted with the ability to induce apoptosis.  Results  Selection of Diverse Mutant p53s. In our yeast assay, most of the 2,314 mutant p53s represented either wild-type transcriptional activity or no activity in the examination of p53-binding sequences derived from the p53 target genes. In the remaining mutant p53s (635 mutations), the transcriptional activity was increased in p53 binding sequence(s), decreased in p53 binding sequence(s) or both increased and decreased in distinct p53 binding sequences (22). These mutant p53s with diverse transcriptional activity for distinct p53 binding sequences were defined as diverse mutant p53 (see Materials and Methods). We randomly selected 179 diverse mutant p53s (\\u223c30%) to analyze for their ability to induce apoptosis. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, most of the mutant p53s have been reported only a few times, if at all, in human cancers. The diverse mutant p53s were further classified into three subgroups. The first subclass (106) contained mutant p53s with decreased transcriptional activities for one or more but not all of the eight p53 binding sequences; the second subclass (18) contained mutant p53s with increased transcriptional activities for one or more of the eight p53 binding sequences; and the third subclass (55) contained mutant p53s with both decreased and increased transcriptional activities for some of the eight p53 binding sequences. The proportions were nearly identical in the whole diverse mutant p53s (data not shown).  The Ability to Induce Apoptosis among the Selected Diverse Mutant p53s. In addition to the 179 diverse mutant p53s, we used six tumor-derived common mutant p53s (R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273H, and R273C) as known controls with no or less ability to induce apoptosis. The mutant p53-expression vectors with one of the 185 mutations, a null p53 vector, and a wild-type p53 expression vector were introduced into Saos-2 cells. To confirm the expression level of p53 protein, either wild-type p53 (pCR259-p53WT) or each of the eight representative mutant p53s (pCR259-p53MTs) was introduced into Saos-2 cells and the expression of the expressed p53 was detected by immunoblot analysis as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, the amount of expressed p53 protein was comparable and nearly identical among the distinct p53 expression vectors. To evaluate the ability to induce apoptosis in these 185 mutant p53s and wild-type p53, \\u0394subG1 was calculated after repeated FACS analyses (see Materials and Methods). The \\u0394subG1 ranged from 0.2 to 17.9, and there was diversity in the ability to induce apoptosis among 185 mutant p53s ( Fig. 1 ). The \\u0394subG1 of wild-type p53 was 8.4 \\u00b1 3.3 (mean \\u00b1 SD) and the \\u0394subG1 of 94 mutant p53s (50.8%) were within this range (5.1-11.7), indicating that these were mutant p53s with equivalent or comparable ability to the wild-type p53. The \\u0394subG1 of S121F, a known super p53, was 15.7 \\u00b1 2.1, significantly larger than that of wild-type p53. The \\u0394subG1 of 17 mutant p53s (S121C, S121A, S121Y, Q144R, P153H, R156C, I162M, F212Y, H214Q, S215C, E221Q, R290G, K291E, K291Q, K291T, K292T, and K292I) fell at or above this range (>13.6). These mutants were considered to be more potent than wild-type p53 and to be equally or more potent than S121F. The \\u0394subG1 of R175H, a loss-of-function mutation, was 2.7 \\u00b1 1.9. The \\u0394subG1 of 37 mutant p53s (20.0%) fell at or below this range (<4.6), indicating that these were also loss-of-function mutant p53s, similar to R175H. These results indicated that mutant p53s with diverse transcriptional activities for distinct p53 binding sequences also had diversity in their ability to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that there were several mutant p53s with more potent activity than wild-type p53 in the induction of apoptosis when overexpressed in Saos-2 cells. To confirm this observation, FACS analysis was done thrice on the 17 mutant p53s and S121F as well as wild-type p53. Nine mutant p53s (H214Q, K291E, K292T, Q144R, R290G, I162M, K291T, S121A, and S121C) were reconfirmed to have significantly more potent ability to induce apoptosis than wild-type p53 (unpaired t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 2 ). We defined the nine mutant p53s as novel super p53s. A representative DNA histogram is shown in Fig. 3 . The remaining eight mutant p53s (F212Y, E221Q, K291Q, S121Y, R156C, S215C, K292I and P153H) also had more potent ability than wild-type p53 but were not statistically significant (P = 0.053-0.095). The ability to induce apoptosis in the 17 mutant p53s was not statistically different from that of S121F. We noted that the \\u0394subG1 in the six common mutant p53s, R175H, G245S, R248W, R249S, R273H, and R273C, were 2.7, 3.4, 4.6, 0.7, 1.1, and 0.6, respectively, significantly smaller than wild-type p53.

Horizontal bars indicate the range of the subG1 fraction. Inhibition of Saos-2 Cell Proliferation by Novel Super p53s. To examine whether novel super p53s inhibit cell proliferation, we selected six of nine super p53s. The viable cells were counted at 2 or 3 days after the introduction of these mutant p53s by lipofection. All the six mutant p53s inhibited Saos-2 cell proliferation more strongly than wild-type p53 (Supplementary Fig. 2). In particular, the inhibition by H214Q, K291E, and K292T was significantly stronger than wild-type p53 (unpaired t test, P = 0.009, 0.003, and 0.017, respectively). These results indicated that the stronger ability to induce apoptosis of mutant p53s correlated with their ability to inhibit cell proliferation.  Reevaluation of Transcriptional Activity for Each Mutant p53 in Saos-2 cells. Although the 179 mutant p53s were selected for their transcriptional activity in yeast, we reevaluated those in human cells because we considered that there might be differences in cellular environments and transcriptional machinery between the two cell systems. To analyze the transcriptional activities of the 179 mutant p53s as well as the six common mutant p53s, wild-type p53, and null p53 on the six distinct p53 target genes in human cells, the transcriptional activity of each mutant p53 was evaluated as the relative transcriptional activity for wild-type p53 by luciferase assay (Supplementary Table 2). The mean transcriptional activity in the p53 target genes (WAF1, BAX, MDM2, 14-3-3\\u03c3, p53AIP1, and PUMA) in 179 diverse mutant p53s was 0.680 (0.024-1.531), 0.663 (0.064-2.262), 0.855 (0.033-1.790), 0.998 (0.071-2.354), 0.664 (0.046-1.910), and 1.531 (0.325-3.213), respectively, with a wide range of values indicating that the transcriptional activity of the diverse mutant p53s in yeast was also diverse in human cells. Conversely, those in the six common mutant p53s were 0.019 (0.008-0.067), 0.075 (0.064-0.096), 0.043 (0.030-0.078), 0.111 (0.082-0.20), 0.236 (0.175-0.331), and 0.271 (0.156-0.351), respectively, indicating that the transcriptional activity of the common mutant p53s was significantly lower than wild-type p53 in all of the six p53 target genes as indicated in yeast. Overall, the transcriptional activity of the examined mutant p53s was roughly similar between the two cell systems, although they were not always identical (refer to Supplementary information and Supplementary Fig. 3).  No Evident Correlation between the Ability to Induce Apoptosis and Transcriptional Activity in the 179 Diverse Mutant p53s. To evaluate the correlation between the transcriptional activity (standardized value) on the six distinct p53 target genes and the \\u0394subG1 in the 179 diverse mutant p53s, these two values were plotted and shown in Fig. 4 . The correlation coefficient (r) between the two values on each p53 target gene, WAF1, BAX, MDM2, 14-3-3\\u03c3, p53AIP1, or PUMA, was 0.167 (P = 0.025), 0.002 (P = 0.983), 0.014 (P = 0.848), 0.053 (P = 0.482), \\u22120.008 (P = 0.914), or 0.013 (P = 0.864), respectively. These results indicated that there was no significant correlation between the ability to induce apoptosis and the transcriptional activity in any single, p53 target gene in 179 mutant p53s. The mean transcriptional activities of the S121F and the 17 mutant p53s with potent ability to induce apoptosis (see above) in the six p53 target genes, WAF1, BAX, MDM2, 14-3-3\\u03c3, p53AIP1, and PUMA, were 0.875 (0.141-1.373), 0.730 (0.128-1.169), 0.851 (0.120-1.534), 1.110 (0.291-1.951), 0.612 (0.273-0.870), and 1.538 (0.805-2.443), respectively. Again, there was little relationship between the transcriptional activity and the ability to induce apoptosis in the 18 mutant p53s ( Fig. 4).  Figure 4.

Hierarchical Clustering of Mutant p53s in Their Transcriptional Activity. The transcriptional activity of 185 mutant p53s, wild-type p53, and null p53 in the distinct p53 target genes were analyzed by hierarchical clustering (see Materials and Methods). The result is shown in Fig. 5 . All common mutant p53s but G245S were classified in a single cluster with no transcriptional activity in any target genes. The 18 mutant p53s with potent ability to induce apoptosis were not clustered at all.  Figure 5. Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Figure 5.

This study started with 635 diverse mutant p53s that had been selected in a yeast-based functional assay (22). From the initial stage of this study, we believed that novel super p53 should be identified from those mutant p53s and considered that such mutant p53s might provide a clue to induce apoptosis in tumor cells efficiently. The 179 mutant p53s were expressed in human cells under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter and were evaluated for their ability to induce apoptosis. Consequently, we identified 17 mutant p53s with potent activity for apoptosis including nine super p53s (see above). We now predict that there are more unidentified super p53s in the remaining pool of the diverse mutant p53s. We are also trying to introduce the super p53 into a mouse tumor xenograft model to examine the antitumor effect in vivo. The super p53s may also provide a clue to develop novel cancer therapies to efficiently induce apoptosis in cancer cells by analyzing their transcriptional profiles when expressed in cells.  Relationship between the Ability to Induce Apoptosis and p53 Structure. To examine the correlation between the ability to induce apoptosis and the p53 domain, the \\u0394subG1 in 179 diverse mutant p53s were plotted on p53 motif for the primary structure (Supplementary Fig. 4). One hundred fifty-six mutant p53s were mapped on the core domain (residue 96-300) containing sequence-specific DNA binding domain (residues 96-286, 146 mutant p53s) and the carboxyl-terminal flanking region (residues 287-300, 10 mutant p53s). The remaining 23 mutant p53s were plotted on the amino-terminal region (residues 1-95, 13 mutant p53s) or the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 301-393, 10 mutant p53s). Obviously, the diverse mutant p53s were concentrated in the central core domain. Interestingly, among the 18 mutant p53s with more potent ability to induce apoptosis than that of wild-type p53, four (S121F, S121C, S121A, and S121Y) and six (R290G, K291E, K291Q, K291T, K292T and K292I) mutant p53s were mapped at residue 121 in the L1 loop and residues 290 to 292 in the flanking region to the H2 helix, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although the intramolecular alteration caused by these substitutions was not clear, we speculate two possibilities. First, these substitutions affect the local or global p53 structure and the resulting structures are beneficial for apoptosis induction. Second, these substitutions interfere p53-interacting protein(s) that modulate the apoptotic function of p53. Obviously, additional experiments are necessary to elucidate their molecular mechanisms.  Lack of Correlation between Ability to Induce Apoptosis and p53 Transcriptional Activity. Our previous knowledge of p53-dependent apoptosis was that, after genotoxic stress, activated p53 transactivates its downstream genes in a sequence-specific manner and induces apoptosis in cells through the direct and/or indirect induction of the downstream protein(s). The transactivation-dependent theory has been supported by many genetic and biochemical experiments and is supported because the tumor-derived common mutations have no ability to transactivate downstream genes and to induce apoptosis. However, we also considered that the theory should be reevaluated carefully for the following reasons. First, the transactivation-independent mechanism of p53-dependent apoptosis has been reported by several laboratories. Second, most of the remaining mutations have not been examined for their ability to induce apoptosis. Taking advantage of an opportunity to use the comprehensive mutant p53 library (22), we may examine all of the mutant p53s in the future. Unfortunately, plasmid construction and the functional evaluation of \\u223c2,000 mutant p53s in mammalian cells are currently labor-intensive. Selecting a limited number of mutations from the p53 mutation library would be an alternative approach. In this study, we chose to analyze 179 mutant p53s from 635 diverse mutant p53s and avoided selecting mutant p53s from 905 mutant p53s with intact transcriptional activity or from 361 mutant p53s with complete loss of transcriptional activity. This was because most of the former mutant p53s may retain both transactivation-dependent and -independent apoptosis, whereas the later mutant p53s may not retain both. Therefore, we may not be able to address the relationship between the ability to induce apoptosis and p53 transcriptional activity using the intact and inactive mutant p53s, and therefore, cannot estimate the feasibility of the theory or the transactivation-independent mechanism. Our results from the 179 diverse mutant p53s suggested that there was no relationship between the transcriptional activity of any single specific gene and the ability to induce apoptosis. This was also the case in super p53, and there was no common target gene responsible for strong apoptosis by super p53. These results suggested that transactivation-dependent apoptosis does not play a major role in p53-dependent apoptosis.  Combining these results with previous reports, we propose at least three possibilities. First, the induction of apoptosis by p53 does not depend on any single p53 downstream gene and rather requires the harmonized transcriptional up- and down-regulation of p53 target genes. Considering these results, hierarchical clustering for 179 mutant p53s and their transcriptional activity with the six promoters was done because we considered that there might be subcluster(s) containing a specific class of mutant p53s, such as the super p53s, beyond the single gene analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, no cluster(s) preferentially contained super p53s. Because there are several p53 downstream genes, there may still be insufficient information to classify these specific mutant p53s into a specific subcluster. To elucidate this and the transactivation-independent mechanism underlying super p53, we are planning to perform comprehensive expression analysis of the mutant p53-expressing cells by DNA microarray. Second, interaction of other proteins with p53 may affect p53 stability, localization, and p53-dependent apoptosis in the series of mutant p53s, making it difficult to understand the mechanisms in p53-dependent apoptosis. Finally, transactivation-independent apoptosis is more important than transactivation-dependent apoptosis in p53-dependent apoptosis mechanisms. Additional experiments are necessary to evaluate which mechanism is important for p53-dependent apoptosis.\",\n          \"Argonaute (Ago) 2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNA interference, but little is known concerning the regulation of Ago2 by cell-signaling pathways. In this study we show that expression of Ago2, but not Ago1, Ago3, or Ago4, is elevated in estrogen receptor (ER) \\u03b1-negative (ER\\u03b1\\u2212) vs. ER\\u03b1-positive (ER\\u03b1+) breast cancer cell lines, and in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast tumors. In MCF-7 cells the low level of Ago2 was found to be dependent upon active ER\\u03b1/estrogen signaling. Interestingly, the high expression of Ago2 in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cells was severely blunted by inhibition of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/MAPK signaling pathway, using either a pharmacological MAPK kinase inhibitor, U0126, or a small interfering RNA directed against EGF receptor. Half-life studies using cycloheximide indicated that EGF enhanced, whereas U0126 decreased, Ago2 protein stability. Furthermore, a proteosome inhibitor, MG132, blocked Ago2 protein turnover. The functional consequences of elevated Ago2 levels were examined by stable transfection of ER\\u03b1+ MCF-7 cells with full-length and truncated forms of Ago2. The full-length Ago2 transfectants displayed enhanced proliferation, reduced cell-cell adhesion, and increased migratory ability, as shown by proliferation, homotypic aggregation, and wound healing assays, respectively. Overexpression of full-length Ago2, but not truncated forms of Ago2 or an empty vector control, reduced the levels of E-cadherin, \\u03b2-catenin, and \\u03b2-actin, as well as enhanced endogenous miR-206 activity. These data indicate that Ago2 is regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level, and also implicate Ago2 and enhanced micro-RNA activity in the tumorigenic progression of breast cancer cell lines.  Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small (19\\u201324 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional gene silencing through specific base pairing with target mRNAs. Once precursor miRNAs are processed and exported to the cytosol, one strand of the resulting miRNA duplex (guide strand) is incorporated into Argonaute (Ago)-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (1,2,3). These complexes are then directed to the 3\\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs where imperfect base pairing to the respective miRNA induces gene silencing via translational repression or mRNA cleavage/destabilization (4,5,6). The process of mRNA cleavage is mediated by the endonuclease activity of Ago2 containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (7,8,9).  Ago2 is a member of a family of eight proteins in mammals, four of which are germ line specific (10). Ago proteins contain a P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI) domain that can adopt a ribonuclease H fold with potentially innate endonuclease activity (11,12,13,14). However, Ago2 is the only Ago protein shown to mediate miRNA-dependent cleavage/degradation of target mRNAs in mammals. Recently, studies have also implicated functional roles for Ago2 independent of its endonuclease activity (15,16,17,18,19). Ago2 has been observed as diffuse within the cytoplasm, and localized to both processing bodies (P bodies) and the nucleus (20).  Recent studies indicate that Ago2 is required for a variety of developmental processes that occur in a tissue-specific manner. For instance, Ago2-null mice are embryonic lethal, potentially due to neural tube defects (12,21). Disruption of Ago2 leads to gastrulation arrest and uncontrolled mesoderm expansion in mice through overactive Fgf8 signaling (22). Ago2 also plays a role in hematopoiesis because bone marrow conditional Ago2\\u2212/\\u2212 mice have defective B-cell differentiation (23). Given these findings, the fact that no functional redundancy exists between Ago2 and other Ago paralogs highlights the importance of Ago2-miRNA complexes within various developmental processes (24).  Recently, microarray expression studies have indicated that genes involved in miRNA biogenesis are dysregulated in various breast tumor types (25,26). In particular, expression of Ago2 is elevated in the estrogen receptor (ER) \\u03b1-negative (ER\\u03b1\\u2212) ERBB2-negative [human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2\\u2212)] epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-positive (EGFR+) basal-like breast tumor subtype. Furthermore, Ago2 expression also negatively correlates with ER\\u03b1 status in gene profiling studies performed on various breast tumor samples (27). Although these studies implicate Ago2 in more aggressive breast tumor types, to date no studies have determined whether Ago2 is involved specifically in the tumorigenic process.  Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States, and approximately one third of invasive breast carcinomas will be diagnosed as ER\\u03b1\\u2212 (28,29). In patients with ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast tumors, treatment options are limited because established antihormone adjuvant therapies (i.e. tamoxifen and CYP19-aromatase inhibitors) are ineffective at ablating tumor growth (30). In addition, this tumor type is more transformed and proliferates independent of estrogenic-stimulated signaling, leading to poor clinical outcomes (29,30). Transcriptional profiling has allowed for the categorization of breast cancer into several subtypes. The two main ER\\u03b1\\u2212 subtypes are designated as either \\u201cbasal-like\\u201d or \\u201cHER2,\\u201d which frequently overexpress the EGFR or the related ERRB2/HER2 protein, respectively. In this study we demonstrate that Ago2 is up-regulated by an EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cell lines, whereas overexpression of Ago2 is sufficient to drive breast tumor progression in the ER\\u03b1+ MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell line.  Go to: Materials and Methods Cell lines and tissue samples  Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, CA) and Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO). All breast cancer cell lines were obtained through American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for standard culture (serum). Cells cultured in hormone-depleted media (HDM) were grown with media supplemented with 10% charcoal-treated dextran-stripped FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT). Stably transfected cells were maintained in DMEM/F12, 10% FBS, and 250 \\u03bcg/ml G418.  Human primary breast carcinomas (\\u22651.5 cm) were obtained from consenting patients under an institutional review board approved protocol within 5 min of surgical resection, and frozen in optimal cutting temperature media at \\u221280 C. Cryosections were evaluated for areas of high tumor cell density via hematoxylin and eosin stain. Tissue cores were obtained with a 2-mm dermal punch, harvested for RNA via the RNAeasy Kit from QIAGEN, Inc. (Valencia, CA), and processed for reverse transcription and hybridization to Illumina\\u2019s Human-8 cDNA array according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Gene expression analysis was performed with Bead Studio software from Illumina using Rank invariant normalization. Individual gene values were used only if multiple probe signals had P values less than 0.05.  Luciferase reporter assays  Firefly luciferase reporter assays for miR-206 activity were performed on breast cancer cell lines essentially as described (31). Luciferase activity generated from the pIS-ER\\u03b1-1 constructs were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system in combination with a Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-TK), to control for transfection efficiency, from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Results were reported as the average relative luciferase activity from three independent experiments normalized to Renilla activity \\u00b1 sem.  Chemical inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatments  Breast cancer cell lines were treated with various hormones and selective inhibitors, purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Cells at 80% confluence were washed and switched to drug-containing media, which included 17\\u03b2-estradiol (E2), propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), diarylpropionitrile (DPN), U0124, U0126, and/or EGF (Sigma-Aldrich). After 24 h cells were washed and retreated with the appropriate drug so cumulative effects could be determined at 48 h. Treatment duration was 12 h during studies using the MG132 compound. For siRNA experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with EGFR siRNA (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO), and protein lysates were isolated after 24 h.  Cycloheximide (CHX) stability studies  MDA-MB-231 cells at 80% confluency were treated with 200 \\u03bcm CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min (zero time point). Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF, 10 \\u03bcm U0126, 10 \\u03bcm PD153035, or any combination of the aforementioned, plus 200 \\u03bcm CHX. At each time point (0, 0.5, 3, and 6 h) after drug treatments, cells were harvested for protein in 250 \\u03bcl radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer/well. Western blot analysis was performed on 15 \\u03bcl sample, and densitometry readings of the Ago2-specific band were reported. These values were normalized to amount loaded on the gel, which is equivalent to total cell number, and reported as the mean of three independent experiments \\u00b1 sem.  Quantitative real-time PCR detection assay  For mRNA and miRNA detection, real-time PCR assays were performed on 100 ng/\\u03bcl total RNA isolated from various cell lines and treatment conditions, using trizol reagent from Invitrogen, as previously described (31). Primers used in this study are described in supplemental Table S1, which is published as supplemental data on The Endocrine Society\\u2019s Journals Online web site at http://endo.endojournals.org. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate and normalized to either RPL-19 or 5s RNA. In some instances end-point RT-PCR assays were performed. For these assays the PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide.  Western blot analysis  Western blot analyses were performed essentially as described (31). Antibodies to Ago2 (1:2000) and ER\\u03b1 (1:000) from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA), ER\\u03b2 (1:000) and EGFR (1:1500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), E-cadherin (1:1000) and \\u03b2-catenin (1:1000) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), Ago1 (1:1000), \\u03b2-actin (1:1000), and c-myc (1:500) from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), \\u03b1-tubulin (1:1000) from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC), and Ki67 (1:1000) from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA) were used in conjunction with either antimouse, antirat, or antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein expression was detected via ECL Plus from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp. (Piscataway, NJ) and chemiluminescent film from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). Resultant band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software from National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD).  Generation of the MCF-7-Ago2 transfectants  All basic molecular biology and transfection reagents used to make the MCF-7-Ago2 transfectants were obtained from Invitrogen. MCF-7 cells were cultured to 90% confluency and transfected with pcDNA 3.1 expression constructs harboring either full-length Ago2 [MCF7-Ago2-wild type (WT)] or N-terminal-truncated mutant Ago2 (MCF-7-Ago2_167C and MCF-7-Ago2_408C) myc-tagged cDNAs (32), or pcDNA 3.1 alone (MCF-7-empty) as a control. After 24 h, cells were washed and cultured in medium containing 850 \\u03bcg/ml G418 every 48 h for 3 wk. After selection, each pool of cells, five from each cell type/transfectant, were trypsinized and cultured in a six-well plate containing medium plus 250 \\u03bcg/ml G418. The pooled transfectants were screened for Ago2 and myc-tagged expression by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Transfectants with 2-fold or more enrichment in Ago2 over parental MCF-7 cells (MCF-7-Par) were classified as Ago2high and characterized.  Trypan blue proliferation assays  The Trypan blue viability assays were performed on the five MCF-7 cell transfectants over the course of 96 h. After seeding in 12-well culture plates at 3 \\u00d7 104 cells per well, the number of viable cells were determined every 24 h by trypsinization of cells, resuspension in growth medium, 1:4 dilution with 0.4% Trypan blue stain, and hemocytometer counts. Values generated are representative of three independent experiments and are reported as the average viable cell number \\u00b1 sem.  Homotypic aggregation assay  Breast cancer cells and transfectants (1 \\u00d7 105) were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml culture medium. Each tube was incubated at 37 C for 0.5 h with 0.5 \\u03bcl 2 mg/ml Calcein-AM (Invitrogen). Samples were centrifuged at 460 \\u00d7 g for 10 min, washed with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml culture medium, and placed on a rocker for 1.5 h at 37 C. Five hundred microliters of 3.75% formaldehyde were added to each tube, and the cell mixture was transferred to three wells within a 12-well culture dish. Fluorescent and phase-contrast images of cell aggregates were obtained using a Zeiss Stemi SV11 stereomicroscope with an AttoArc HBO 100W power source (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY), whereas quantification of aggregates was measured using a hemocytometer, where all nine grids were counted.  Wound healing/migration assay  Various breast cancer cells and transfectants were seeded into 24-well plates. Once cells reached confluence, a wound was made in the center of each well using a 200-\\u03bcl pipette tip. At each time point after wound formation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 100% methanol, rinsed with PBS, and stained with 1% crystal violet. Images of each wound were captured on a Zeiss SV11 stereomicroscope from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging and imported into Adobe Photoshop 8.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Using the measure tool within the software, five measurements were taken of the distance between the two migrating fronts. Data were recorded as width of wound (mm) \\u00b1 sem.  Statistical analysis  Values reported in all analyses were expressed as the mean \\u00b1 sem, and densitometry readings from Western blots were reported as averages. Differences between treatments and/or groups were analyzed by ANOVA with either a Dunnett or Bonferroni multiple comparison after test using GraphPad Instat Software 3.0. Statistical significance was accepted at P < 0.05.  Go to: Results Ago2 mRNA levels and protein expression are elevated in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cell lines  Ago2 expression was initially compared between ER\\u03b1+ and ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cell lines. Ago2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435) than ER\\u03b1+ lines (T47D and MCF-7), whereas Ago1 protein levels remained unchanged in all cell lines tested (Fig. 11,, A and B). In particular, MCF-7 cells had 4.4 \\u00b1 0.21-fold lower Ago2 protein levels, when compared with either of the ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cell lines. The T47D cells had undetectable levels of Ago2 expression, as assayed by Western blot and end-point PCR analyses.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Ago2 expression is highly abundant in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cell lines. A, End-point RT-PCR of endogenous Ago1-4 and RPL-19 mRNA levels in the four breast cancer cell types, as well as HeLa cell lines. After 25 cycles (Ago1, Ago2, RPL-19) ... To determine whether the inverse correlation between Ago2 levels and ER\\u03b1 positivity occurs in human breast tumors, we obtained data from a human-8 cDNA array performed on total RNA isolated from three ER\\u03b1+ and five ER\\u03b1\\u2212 human breast tumors (Fig. 1C1C).). Although the sample size was small, ER\\u03b1\\u2212 tumor samples had significantly higher Ago2 levels when compared with ER\\u03b1+ tumor tissue (1.5 \\u00b1 0.05-fold; P < 0.005). Furthermore, expression of Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4 did not change within these tumors. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Ago2 is selectively dysregulated between two breast tumor subtypes.  One hypothesis formed from these findings was that ER\\u03b1/estrogen signaling suppressed Ago2 expression. However, E2 and the ER\\u03b1-selective agonist, PPT, enhanced Ago2 levels in hormone-depleted MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D1D).  Inhibition of EGFR/MAPK signaling reduces Ago2 expression in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cells  Two mechanisms by which Ago2 could be up-regulated in the ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cells are through gene amplification and/or constitutive activation of a cell-signaling cascade. Semiquantitative end-point PCR performed on genomic DNA isolated from the four breast cancer cell lines revealed no evidence indicative of Ago2 gene amplification (data not shown).  EGFR and the MAPK signaling cascade represent a major class of signal transduction pathways in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancers (33,34,35,36). To determine whether EGFR is required for Ago2 protein expression, Western blot experiments were performed on MDA-MB-231 cells treated with EGFR siRNA in the presence of serum-containing growth medium. After 24 h 100 nm small interfering EGFR (siEGFR) treatment, Ago2 expression was reduced 9.1 \\u00b1 0.25-fold, whereas \\u03b2-actin and ER\\u03b2 expression remained constant (Fig. 2A2A).). Similarly, 100 ng/ml EGF for 48 h elevated Ago2 mRNA and protein levels approximately 1.5-fold (Fig. 3A3A).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Abrogating MAPK signaling reduces Ago2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 0\\u2013100 nm siEGFR for 24 h, and analyzed for Ago2, EGFR, ER\\u03b2, and \\u03b2-actin protein expression via Western blot. The numbers ... Figure 3 Figure 3 EGF enhances Ago2 protein stability through active EGFR/MAPK signaling. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10 \\u03bcm U0126 and/or 100 ng/ml EGF for 48 h, and Ago2 mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR (left panel). Values (mean + sem ... To ascertain whether EGF stimulated Ago2 expression through the MAPK pathway, ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cells were treated with U0126, a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or U0124, an inactive U0126 analog. Western blot analyses indicated that the U0124 compound had no effect on Ago2 protein levels, whereas, 48 h 10 \\u03bcm U0126 treatment decreased Ago2 expression to nondetectable levels (Fig. 2B2B).). Real-time PCR analysis of dose-response experiments indicated that 10 \\u03bcm U0126 significantly reduced Ago2 transcript levels after 48 h by 3.3 \\u00b1 0.15-fold and 2.5 \\u00b1 0.21-fold in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively (Fig. 2C2C).). The effect of U0126 was specific, in that RPL-19 and Ago1 mRNA levels remained unchanged. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Ago2 mRNA levels were the same after treatment with either 100 ng/ml EGF plus 10 \\u03bcm U0126, or with U0126 alone (Fig. 3A3A,, left panel). These data indicate that the MAPK pathway serves as the primary mediator of EGF-stimulated induction of Ago2 gene expression in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cells.  EGF enhances Ago2 protein stability through MAPK signaling in MDA-MB-231 cell lines  Results from Western blot analyses of the experiments described previously revealed that Ago2 protein expression did not correlate with transcript levels under certain conditions. Specifically, 100 ng/ml EGF plus 10 \\u03bcm U0126 enhanced Ago2 expression at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level, compared with U0126 alone (Fig. 3A3A).). Previous studies have shown that EGF, via EGFR, can promote protein stability through phosphorylation and/or the prevention of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation (37,38,39,40,41). To test the notion that Ago2 protein levels are regulated by the proteasome, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with 10 \\u03bcm MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor (Fig. 3B3B).). Twelve hours after MG132 treatment, Ago2 protein levels were enhanced approximately 3.1-fold in cells pretreated with or without 10 \\u03bcm U0126. These data indicate that in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cells, EGF enhances Ago2 stability posttranslationally.  To test further that EGF-EGFR signaling increases Ago2 protein stability, CHX half-life studies were performed on EGF and/or U0126 treated MDA-MB-231 cells. After 6 h, Ago2 was reduced 2.5 \\u00b1 0.14-fold in CHX plus U0126 treated samples when compared with the CHX alone control (Fig. 3C3C).). This reduction was ablated by 1.7 \\u00b1 0.12-fold in CHX, U0126, and EGF treated cells. The use of 10 \\u03bcm PD153035, an EGFR inhibitor, confirmed that the loss of EGFR signaling leads to an immediate reduction, 1.7 \\u00b1 0.11-fold by 0.5 h, in Ago2 stability. These findings indicate that EGFR signaling, through an as of yet unidentified pathway, is essential for maintaining Ago2 protein expression and stability in MDA-MB-231 cells.  Generation and characterization of the Ago2 overexpressing (MCF-7-Ago2-WT) cell types  Because Ago2 is regulated by an oncogenic signaling cascade in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 cells, we examined whether increased Ago2 expression induced a transformed phenotype. Ago2 was stably overexpressed in the less transformed ER\\u03b1+ MCF-7 cell line as described in Materials and Methods. For each of the Ago2 cell types generated, three of the five pooled MCF-7 cell transfectants were classified as having Ago2high expression (Fig. 4A4A).). Specifically, MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants had 2.5 \\u00b1 0.11-fold and 2.9 \\u00b1 0.18-fold greater Ago2 mRNA and protein levels, respectively, compared with MCF-7-Par cells. Because the Ago2 antibody used in these screening experiments recognized the N-terminal region of Ago2, expression of the Ago2 N-terminal deletion mutants in the MCF-7 cells were determined by c-myc epitope-tag expression and Ago2 mRNA levels. Our analysis indicated that MCF-7-Ago2 mutants expressed Ago2 at levels comparable to the MCF-7-Ago2-WT cell types.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Overexpression of Ago2 induces alterations in the phenotype of MCF-7 cells. A, MCF-7-Ago2 transfectants (MCF-7-Ago2-WT, MCF-7-Ago2_167C, and MCF-7-Ago2_408C) were screened for myc-epitope and Ago2 expression by Western blot analysis (left panel). The ... We previously showed that miR-206 targets two sites (ER\\u03b1-1 and ER\\u03b1-2) within the 3\\u2032-UTR of the ER\\u03b1 mRNA (31). This was done by insertion of each predicted site into the 3\\u2032-UTR of the pIS-0 luciferase reporter construct. We also observed that miR-206 induced degradation of pIS-ER\\u03b1-1 luciferase mRNA only in cells that contained endogenous Ago2 (supplemental Fig. S1). Based on these findings, cells that overexpress Ago2 protein would presumably have enhanced miR-206 activity. To test this, pIS-ER\\u03b1-1 constructs were transiently transfected into the five MCF-7 cell types for 24 h to determine their miR-206 activity (Fig. 4B4B,, left panel). In the MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells, miR-206 activity on pIS-ER\\u03b1-1-WT and pIS-ER\\u03b1-1-single nucleotide polymorphism constructs were enhanced by 1.3 \\u00b1 0.12-fold and 2.1 \\u00b1 0.13-fold, respectively, when compared with MCF-7-Par cells. No change in miR-206 activity was observed in cells transfected with the pIS-ER\\u03b1-1-5\\u2032 mutant construct, or with any construct used in the MCF-7-empty and MCF-7-Ago2 mutant transfectants. Real-time PCR experiments on the five MCF-7 cell types confirmed that these results were due to changes in Ago2 expression and not miR-206 levels (Fig. 4B4B,, right panel). Thus, MCF-7-Ago2 cells express elevated levels of functional Ago2, which correlates with enhanced miR-206 activity.  Elevated Ago2 levels did not result in reduced ER\\u03b1 expression (Fig. 4B4B,, bottom panel). In fact, MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants had elevated ER\\u03b1 protein levels. This is discordant with the finding that Ago2 overexpression resulted in elevated activity of a miRNA, miR-206, that targets ER\\u03b1, and indicates that there is a greater concentration of miRNAs that target proteins involved in ER\\u03b1 suppression than those that target ER\\u03b1 itself.  Trypan blue proliferation assays performed on the various MCF-7 transfectants indicated that after 96 h, the number of viable MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells was 1.9 \\u00b1 0.14-fold greater than the other four MCF-7 cell types (Fig. 4C4C).). Further evidence of enhanced proliferation was obtained by Western blot analysis for the expression of Ki67 antigen, a cell-cycle related nuclear protein (Fig. 4D4D).). The levels of Ki67 were enhanced 2.5 \\u00b1 0.12-fold in the MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants when compared with the other MCF-7 cell types. These findings suggest that the expression of functional Ago2 protein (i.e. miRNA-responsive) stimulates cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells.  Ago2 expression correlates with a scattered phenotype and promotes loss of cell adhesion  In addition to enhanced proliferation, the MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants displayed a distinct \\u201cscattered\\u201d phenotype not shared by any other MCF-7 cell type. Because MCF-7 cells normally grow in tight colonies, this \\u201cscattered\\u201d phenotype is indicative of reduced cell-cell adhesion. Homotypic aggregation assays performed to measure this reduction of functional cell-cell adhesion revealed that parental MCF-7, MCF-7-Ago2 mutant, and MCF-7-empty cell types readily formed cell aggregates, whereas the MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells mimicked the phenotype of the nonadherent MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5A5A,, top panel). This finding was verified using Calcein-AM, a fluorescent dye retained in metabolically active cells (Fig. 5A5A,, bottom panel). To quantify the extent of cell aggregation, the number of aggregates was measured via Trypan blue exclusion and counted on a hemocytometer. On average, MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells generated half the number of aggregates compared with parental, empty vector control, or Ago mutant cells (6.3 \\u00d7 103 \\u00b1 0.98 \\u00d7 103 vs. \\u223c11.6 \\u00d7 103 \\u00b1 0.88 \\u00d7 103; P < 0.05), respectively. These results indicate the loss of cell-cell adhesion molecules in the MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants, which is an indicator of tumorigenic transformation.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Ago2 reduces cell adhesion molecule expression and homotypic aggregation. A, Bright-field (top panel) and fluorescent Calcein-AM (bottom panel) images of fixed cell aggregates from a representative experiment are shown. Quantification of the homotypic ... Functional cell-cell adhesion requires the coordinated regulation of a variety of adhesion molecules and associated structural, scaffolding, and signaling proteins. Therefore, Ago2 may be involved in directly silencing the E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex in MCF-7 cells. Real-time PCR assays indicated that \\u03b2-actin, E-cadherin, vinculin, and \\u03b2-catenin mRNA levels were reduced between 1.5- to 4.1-fold in MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells when compared with the other MCF-7 cell types (Fig. 5B5B).). These values were normalized to RPL-19, which remained constant in all five cell types. Western blot analyses performed on the five MCF-7 cell types indicated that \\u03b2-actin, E-cadherin, and \\u03b2-catenin expression were reduced by 2.1 \\u00b1 0.12, 1.5 \\u00b1 0.14, and 1.6 \\u00b1 0.13-fold in the MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells, respectively, whereas tubulin remained unchanged (Fig. 5C5C).). These data support the notion that functional Ago2 can dysregulate functional protein complexes by silencing the key proteins within a given pathway.  Overexpression of Ago2 in MCF-7 cell lines enhances their migratory/invasive properties  Although MCF-7 cells generally have poor invasive capabilities, the MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells had a transformed phenotype similar to the MDA-MB-231 cell line. To test whether Ago2 might enhance the migratory/invasive capabilities of the MCF-7 cell type, wound healing assays were performed over the course of 24 h (Table 11).). MDA-MB-231 cells quickly occupied the wound by 72.8 \\u00b1 8.12% over the course of 24 h, whereas parental MCF-7 cells invaded the wound by only 14.1 \\u00b1 2.31%. However, the MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants were able to infiltrate significantly the wound area by 35.9 \\u00b1 4.56%, compared with the MCF-7-empty transfectants, which only had 17.9 \\u00b1 3.54% wound closure. This migratory phenotype was not observed in the MCF-7-Ago2_167C and MCF-7-Ago2_408C mutant transfectants. These data indicate that Ago2 enhances the migratory capabilities of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, potentially by enhancing the miRNA activity within this cell type.  Table 1 Table 1 Quantification of wound healing in stably transfected MCF-7-Ago2 cells Go to: Discussion miRNAs have emerged as critical factors in the regulation of tumorigenesis. Some miRNAs (e.g. miR-21) are oncogenic, whereas others (e.g. let-7) function as tumor suppressors (42). Numerous miRNAs are differentially expressed in breast tumors. Some of these have been linked to general aspects of breast cancer biology (e.g. cell cycle traverse, metastasis, and apoptosis), and a smaller percentage has been identified as regulators of specific mRNAs in breast cancer cells (e.g. ER\\u03b1, programmed cell death 4 protein, and HER2) (31,43,44,45). Despite the broad range of miRNA-induced phenotypes, all miRNAs studied to date assemble into Ago-miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (7). It has also been shown that a subset of miRNA/mRNA hybrids containing imperfect base pairing can lead to the degradation of the targeted mRNA (46,47). Due to its innate catalytic slicer activity, the cleavage/degradation of target mRNAs by a miRNA requires Ago2 (7,12). As such, this unique action confers a centrally important role upon Ago2 in the biology of normal and transformed cells. Nevertheless, the study of whether the expression of Ago2 itself is regulated, and how changes in Ago2 expression impact normal physiology, development, and tumorigenesis, has largely remained unstudied.  The first major finding of this study was that mRNA levels of Ago2, but not of Agos 1, 3, or 4, were markedly elevated in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast cancer cells when compared with ER\\u03b1+ cells, and Ago2 mRNA levels paralleled this change in protein expression. In addition, microarray analysis on a small panel of human breast tumors revealed a selective increase in Ago2 expression in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 tumors vs. ER\\u03b1+ tumors. Our findings are consistent with a recent report on expression of miRNA biogenesis machinery in various breast cancer samples (26). In this microarray study, Ago2 expression was differentially up-regulated in human ER\\u03b1\\u2212 vs. ER\\u03b1+ breast tumors, whereas other components such as Drosha and other Agos remained unchanged. Thus, elevated Ago2 expression correlates with a transformed phenotype in breast cancer cells, and raises the possibility that elevated Ago2 might augment tumorigenic potential by enhancing miRNA activity.  It is worth indicating that the lower levels of Ago2 in ER\\u03b1+ cells are not due to repression by ER\\u03b1. In fact, estrogen and ER\\u03b1 enhanced Ago2 expression. Although further work is needed to characterize fully the mechanism by which liganded ER\\u03b1 stimulates Ago2 expression, it is noteworthy that the Ago2 promoter harbors a putative estrogen-response element (48).  The second major finding of this study was that the elevated Ago2 expression is a response to the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway. Overexpression and/or activation of the EGFR is a frequent finding in ER\\u03b1\\u2212 breast tumors (49). We observed that EGF stimulated Ago2 gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with siEGFR or the MEK inhibitor, U0126, significantly reduced Ago2 expression. Therefore, transcriptional regulation of the Ago2 gene appears to require intact MAPK signaling downstream of EGFR. A recent transcriptional profiling study described the presence of a \\u201cMAPK signature\\u201d in breast cancer cells (50). This consisted of a subset of approximately 400 genes, whose transcription was either up-regulated or down-regulated by stable overexpression of EGFR, or constitutively active Erbb2, Raf, or MEK, in MCF-7 cells. We propose that Ago2 is a centrally important component of the \\u201cMAPK signature\\u201d in breast cancer cells, whose up-regulation is likely to affect the expression of numerous mRNAs through miRNA/Ago2-dependent mechanisms. Future studies will be aimed at the characterization of transcription factors downstream of the MAPK pathway (e.g. Ets, Jun/Fos) and their interaction with the promoter region of the Ago2 gene.  Combined U0126 and EGF treatments along with MG132 studies indicated that stabilization of Ago2 protein levels are determined, in part, by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. EGFR signaling has modified the stability of specific proteins via posttranslational mechanisms (51,52). Our findings suggest that a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, acting as a tumor suppressor, targets Ago2 in an EGF-suppressible manner. Several E3 ligases have been implicated in breast cancer, both as oncogenes and tumor suppressors (53,54). Thus, Ago2 may be targeted by a breast cancer-related tumor-suppressive E3 ligase, such as BRCA1/BARD1 or CHIP, or by one of the over 500 E3 ligases currently identified.  Alternatively, EGF may increase the biological half-life of Ago2 through an effect on its subcellular localization. A recent study by Zeng et al. (55) demonstrated that Ago2 is phosphorylated on Ser-387 by p38 MAPK, which induced Ago2 localization to P bodies. If, in fact, EGF/MAPK signaling has a similar effect on Ago2, the sequestration to P bodies may contribute to an increased stability of the enzyme.  The third major finding of this study was that moderate overexpression of Ago2 produced a more transformed, less epithelial-like phenotype in MCF-7 cells. We also expressed two Ago2 mutant constructs that generate proteins incapable of mediating miRNA-dependent functions (32). Mutant MCF-7-Ago2_167C and MCF-7-Ago2_ 408C cells, expressed both myc-tagged Ago2 proteins and total (endogenous and exogenous) Ago2 mRNA levels comparable to the MCF-7-Ago-WT cells. In a previous study, we determined the efficiency of miR-206 to target ER\\u03b1 using heterologous luciferase reporters harboring two miR-206 target sites within the ER\\u03b1 3\\u2032-UTR (31). Similar luciferase assays in the various MCF-7-Ago2 transfectants showed that the activity of miR-206 was elevated in MCF-7-Ago2-WT transfectants but remained unchanged in the MCF-7-Ago2 mutant cells. Despite the change in miR-206 activity, mature miR-206 levels remained constant within all MCF-7 cell types. This finding provides evidence that formation of Ago2-miRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes are the rate-limiting factor for miR-206 function within MCF-7 cells, and emphasizes that the relative levels of a miRNA are not the sole determinant of activity.  Two hallmarks of enhanced tumorigenic progression of epithelial cells are the loss of cell-cell adhesion and enhanced cell motility. Both processes contribute to a transformed phenotype that resembles the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during development (56,57,58). MCF-7 cells are poorly tumorigenic in xenograft models, maintain an epithelial-like phenotype due to the presence of cell-cell adhesion molecules, grow in tight colonies, and are weakly motile. In contrast, MCF-7-Ago2-WT cells have a \\u201cscattered\\u201d phenotype reminiscent of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process noted previously. This includes reduced cell-cell adhesion, lower levels of the adhesion molecules E-cadherin and \\u03b2-catenin, and a greater degree of migratory capabilities as measured by the wound healing assay. Because none of the MCF-7-Ago2 mutant cells displayed these transformed phenotypes, the aforementioned findings indicate that enhanced Ago2 expression, along with increased miRNA activity, contribute to the greater degree of transformation within this cell type.  An unexpected finding was that elevated Ago2 associated with increased endogenous ER\\u03b1. This suggests that miRNAs in MCF-7 cells actively target proteins involved in the suppression of ER\\u03b1 expression and/or promotion of the degradation of ER\\u03b1 protein. This enrichment in ER\\u03b1 may also aid in the transformation of the Ago2 transfectants.  Given the complexity of miRNA-mRNA interactions, it is surprising to observe such a clear phenotypical shift toward increased transformation in the Ago2 transfectants. One explanation may lie within the role of miRNAs to dampen transcriptional noise and stochastic variations in mRNAs and corresponding proteins that play a role in the differentiated function of a cell (59). At low levels, Ago2 would allow for such dampening and promote stability of a differentiated phenotype. However, upon elevation of Ago2, the \\u201chomeostatic\\u201d miRNAs could suppress those transcripts involved in a differentiated phenotype to an inappropriately low level, allowing oncogenic pathways to predominate. Ago2 could also promote transformation through miRNA-independent mechanisms. Further work is needed to profile miRNAs and characterize their targets/ physiological roles to test this supposition.  Gastric cancer (GC) is still one of the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with nearly half occurring in China [1, 2]. The prognosis of GC varies remarkably by the stage of cancer with the 5-year relative survival rate reaching 90 % in stage I, but less than 5 % in stage IV. Thus, new markers with high sensitivity and specificity for GC detection and better progression control targets were badly needed.    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered family of short non-coding RNA molecules of about 19\\u201324 nucleotides in length that are involved in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level either by inhibition of the target mRNA or by its destruction [3]. These small molecules have been found to be involved in diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, development, differentiation, apoptosis and others [4, 5, 6]. Researchers also found that miRNAs display aberrant expression patterns and functional abnormalities in all kinds of human diseases including cancers [7, 8, 9]. Patterns of altered miRNA expression in cancer may serve as molecular biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, prognosis of disease-specific outcomes and prediction of therapeutic responses.    Argonaute proteins (Ago1\\u20134) have been demonstrated to be widely expressed and involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing [10]. Researches have identified that Ago2 is the only one with the slicer activity and is highly specialized member of the Ago family with a crucial function within RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the regulation of miRNA homeostasis [11]. Using microarrays to compare control and Ago2\\u2212/\\u2212 cells, recent studies found that Ago2 loss results in the global reduction of mature miRNAs in erythroblasts, fibroblasts and hepatocytes [12]. Ago expression increases or decreases under various physiological conditions, nevertheless, there have been few reports about the relationship between GC and Ago2. The specific role of Ago2 in GC is unknown. In the present study, we systemically investigated the expression of Ago2 in primary GC, corresponding lymph node metastases and non-neoplastic surrounding gastric epithelium, and further analyzed the relation of Ago2 with clinicopathological data and the HER-2 status of GC patients to gain insight into the roles of Ago2 in GC.    Materials and methods  Patients and specimens  The GC specimens were collected from 363 patients undergoing radical resection of primary GC in Jinling Hospital and Suzhou Municipal Hospital between January 2011 and December 2012. In addition, 8 corresponding lymph node metastases as well as 10 non-neoplastic surrounding gastric epithelium were also applied for the Ago2 immunostaining. All patients were selected at their first diagnosis; and none had received radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy before gastrectomy. Patients who had palliative or non-curative operations were excluded. The medical records of the patients were retrospectively reviewed, and the demographic, clinicopathological data, the HER-2 protein expression and HER-2 gene amplification results were also collected. The clinical stage was determined according to the 7th edition of AJCC cancer staging manual [13]. Among the 363 GC patients, HER-2 protein levels were assessed in 295 patients with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scored by two pathologists according to GC HER-2 status guidelines [14]. Briefly, the stain of HER-2 was scored as negative (0) when no membrane staining was observed, or when membrane staining was observed in less than 10 % of the tumor cells; weak positive (1+) if weak focal membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells; intermediate (2+) if weak to moderate, complete membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells; and strongly positive (3+) if intense complete membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells (Fig. 1). In score 2+ cases, HER-2 gene copy number was further analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), performed using the PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (Vysis-Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). HER-2 (specific to the HER-2 gene locus) and CEP 17 (specific to the satellite DNA sequence at the centromeric region of chromosome17). The former stains orange while the latter stains green. At least 100 evaluable nuclei for each case were scored visually in different tumor areas by two independent observers in blind. Amplification was defined as a HER2/ CEP17 ratio higher than 2, or when an HER2 signal cluster was observed. According to the literature [15], a case was considered positive for HER-2 status when revealed a 3+ IHC pattern or a 2+ IHC scoring with a concomitant gene amplification. Finally, there were 49 cases showing 1+, 14 cases with 2+ and 15 cases with 3+ examined by IHC. Moreover, among the 14 cases of HER-2 2+, 3 cases showed HER-2 gene amplification by FISH. Thus, we totally identified 18 cases with HER-2 positive status. Tumor location and size were derived from the surgical report.    Fig. 1  HER-2 status was retrospectively reviewed in 295 GC patients with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scored according to GC HER-2 status guidelines. Briefly, the stain of HER-2 was scored as negative (0) when no membrane staining was observed, or when membrane staining was observed in less than 10 % of the tumor cells (a); weak positive (1+) if weak focal membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells (b); intermediate (2+) if weak to moderate, complete membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells (c); and strongly positive (3+) if intense complete membrane staining was seen in more than 10 % of the tumor cells (d). (Original magnification, \\u00d7400)  All research involving human participants were approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinling Hospital and Suzhou Municipal Hospital. Consent was received from all patients. All clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.    Tissue microarray construction and immunohistochemistry  Tissue microarrays were constructed using the paraffin-embedded 363 primary GC tissue specimens, 8 corresponding lymph node metastases and 10 non-neoplastic surrounding gastric epithelium specimens by a precision arraying instrument (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD, United States) according to the instructions as previously reported [16]. In each case, two tumor cores were selected.    For IHC immunohistochemical staining, 4 \\u03bcm sections were cut and subjected to IHC staining using an automated system (Bench-Mark XT, Ventana Medical System, Tucson, AZ, USA). In brief, tissue sections were incubated with the primary Ago2 antibody (Anti-Ago2, 1:75, abcam, Hamburg, Germany), followed by the secondary antibody, and final detection of immunoreactivity by the diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. After staining, the sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene and covered with Mountex and cover slips.    Evaluation of Ago2 staining was carried out by two independent observers, and the stained area and intensity were scored separately. Specifically, a score of 0 was assigned to a stained area with 0 % reactivity, 1 for an area with >1 % to \\u226410 % of tumor cells, 2 for >11 % to \\u226450 % tumor cells, 3 for >51 % to \\u226480 % tumor cells and 4 for >81 % tumor cells. For the staining intensity, a score of 0 was assigned for absent staining (negative control), 1 for a weak staining obviously stronger than the negative control level, 2 for moderately intense staining and 3 for intense staining. The final grade (0, 12) of the section was derived from the sum of the stained area and intensity scores.    Statistical analyses  All analyses were performed using the SPSS software package, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Correlation analyses of the expression of Ago2 with clinicopathological features were performed using the independent-sample t test or ANOVA followed by LSD method and post hoc Dunnett\\u2019s t tests. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.    Results  Up-regulation of Ago2 in GC tissues  We first examined the protein levels of Ago2 in 363 primary GC tissue specimens, 8 corresponding lymph node metastases and 10 non-neoplastic surrounding gastric epithelium specimens through immunohistochemical methods. We found that histochemical score for Ago2 was 6.75 \\u00b1 3.491 and 6.12 \\u00b1 3.503 in GC and lymph node metastases specimens, respectively, while 3.12 \\u00b1 3.295 in healthy controls. Ago2 expression levels in GC samples and lymph node metastases were significantly higher compared with healthy controls (P = 0.000) (Fig. 2). However, no difference of Ago2 was found between primary GC and lymph node metastases specimens (P > 0.05). Unlike the basolateral staining pattern of HER-2 in GC, the immunostaining pattern of Ago2 was cytoplasmic in the tumor cells.    Fig. 2  Expression of Ago2 was studied by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays generated from 363 gastric cancer patients, 8 corresponding lymph node metastases and 10 non-neoplastic gastric epithelium specimens. We found that negative or weakly staining of Ago2 in non-neoplastic gastric epithelium (a) while overexpressed in GC tissues (b) and lymph node metastases (c). Unlike the basolateral staining pattern of HER-2 in GC, the immunostaining pattern of Ago2 was cytoplasmic in the tumor cells. (Original magnification, \\u00d7200)  Correlation of Ago2 expression with clinicopathological features of GC patients  As shown in Table 1, the present study revealed that Ago2 up-regulation had no correlation with GC patients\\u2019 age, tumor location, tumor size or gross morphology. Although Ago2 showed overexpression more often in T1 and T2 GC tissues, there was no statistically significant association between Ago2 and tumor infiltration (P = 0.107). However, there was a great correlation between Ago2 expression and patients\\u2019 gender (P = 0.004), tumor differentiation (P = 0.007), lymph node invasion (P = 0.000) and clinical stage (P = 0.006) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, Ago2 was also different between groups with different HER-2 status. GC patients with HER-2 positive status (3+ IHC pattern or a 2+ IHC scoring with a concomitant gene amplification) had much lower levels of Ago2 (P < 0.05). Ago2 was higher in HER-2 2+ cases without HER-2 amplification than that of cases with HER-2 amplification (Fig. 4).

The immunoreactivity of Ago2 was much lower in GC tissues with poor differentiation. (Original magnification, \\u00d7200)    Fig. 4  GC specimens with positive HER-2 and negative HER-2 status showed different levels of Ago2. GC tissues with HER-2 2+ (a) (Original magnification, \\u00d7400) and HER-2 amplification (b) (Original magnification, \\u00d71,000) had lower levels of Ago2 (c) (Original magnification, \\u00d7400) than that of the HER-2 2+ (d) (Original magnification, \\u00d7400) cases (f) (Original magnification, \\u00d7400) without HER-2 amplification (e) (Original magnification, \\u00d71,000) which were identified as HER-2 negative according to the literature  Discussion  miRNAs which could regulate global gene expression often act synergistically to repress target genes, and their dysregulation can contribute to the initiation and progression of a variety of cancers as either a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter [17, 18, 19]. The mature miRNA directs a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the complementary target genes and causes inhibition of translation and degradation of the messenger RNA [20, 21]. Ago proteins are the main component of the RISC, among which only Ago2 is the sole catalytic member responsible for cleaving the passenger arm of certain well-duplexed pre-miRNA hairpins [22] and leaving a single-stranded guide RNA that can then regulate other targets [23, 24, 25]. Recently, it was reported that Ago2 has an obligate role in the biogenesis of the conserved vertebrate locus miR-451 [26]. Its precursor serves as a typical Drosha/DGCR8 substrate and loaded directly into Ago proteins as the resultant pre-miRNA hairpin is too short to be cleaved by Dicer. The hairpin population that enters Ago2 is then cleaved and then resected to yield a typical functional miRNA. Thus, Ago2 was thought to be one of the most important components of miRNA biogenesis and RNA interference just like Dicer and Drosha. Although previous studies have reported the altered expression of Dicer and Drosha in kinds of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer, little is known about Ago2 in cancers. To validate the functional roles of Ago2 in GC, here we demonstrated that Ago2 was greatly increased in primary GC tissues and corresponding lymph node metastases compared to that of non-neoplastic gastric epithelium specimens by IHC using TMA technology. Unlike the membrane staining of HER-2 in GC, positive staining of Ago2 was found in the cytoplasm only. Previous studies have identified that Ago2 was not expressed in normal glandular cells in the prostate and normal squamous cells in the esophagus, while it was expressed in 50.0 % of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), 57.0 % of the prostate carcinomas (PCA) and 58.6 % of the ESCC [27]. And compared to the healthy control group, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) groups had significantly higher Ago2 expression levels [28, 29, 30]. High-risk myeloma is associated with global elevation of miRNAs and overexpression of Ago2 [31]. Ago2 was also detected in normal smooth muscle (NSM), as well as leiomyomas (LM) and leiomyosarcomas (LMS). However, study also identified that Ago2 expression was lower in human lung adenocarcinomas than in the paired, non-cancerous tissues [32]. Thus, we proposed that Ago2 may implicate in the genetic and transcriptional alterations that determine the beginning and the development of tumor process. However, more researches should be done to examine whether the alteration of Ago2 is a common event in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we did not find any difference of Ago2 between primary tumors and corresponding metastases, which suggested that Ago2 was maintained unchanged during the metastatic process in most GC cases. Whether Ago2 was a key factor in GC metastasis and whether downregulating Ago2 in GC cells could alter the metastatic potential still need further research both in vivo and in vitro.    Although we did not report a direct correlation between Ago2 and GC patients\\u2019 survival here, our study showed that overexpression of Ago2 was more common in patients with negative HER-2. Ago2 was lower in GC specimens with a HER-2 3+ IHC pattern or a 2+ IHC scoring with a concomitant gene amplification, which were both considered positive for HER-2 status. HER-2 status has been recognized as a critical prognostic factor for GC. The survival time of patients with breast cancer and positive HER-2 disease is significantly shorter than that of those with HER-2 negative tumors [33, 34, 35]. Meanwhile, Ago2 was also found to be associated with tumor differentiation, lymph node invasion and clinical stage, all of which had been demonstrated to be important factors correlated with unfavorable outcomes of GC patients. With these results, we proposed that the aberrant expression of Ago2 may act as an important modulator in cellular pathways in tumorigenesis and GC progression, and may further be served as an indicator for GC prognosis. However, previous researches reported that the expression of Ago2 in prostate and esophageal cancers was not associated with pathologic characteristics, including age, sex, Gleason score (PCA) and stage [27]. Whether this inconsistence was ascribed to the tissue specificity should be further studied, and more research was needed to explore the exact role of Ago2 in different cancers.    The mechanisms underlined the oncogene functions of Ago2 have not been demonstrated clearly at the present time. It has been evidenced that knockdown of Ago2-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells and inhibited siRNA-mediated silencing of transfected oncogenes in HEK-293 cells [36]. Studies also identified that let-7, c-myc and FAK mRNAs were affected by increased Ago2 expression and have been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis [32, 37]. In the present study, we found that Ago2 was correlated to patients\\u2019 gender, which suggested a possible role of hormonal signal in the mechanisms of Ago2. However, further investigations both in vitro and in vivo were needed.    In conclusion, we demonstrated that aberrant Ago2 in GC was associated with HER-2 status and may be involved in GC progression. These findings may shed light on a potential therapeutic strategy to block the pathways of miRNA maturation and functionality, such as Ago2 knockdown.\",\n          \"Several mutations were identi\\u00aeed in the kinase domain of the RET proto-oncogene in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) or sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. We introduced seven mutations (glutamic acid 768?aspartic acid (E768D), valine 804?leucine (V804L), alanine 883?phenylalanine (A883F), serine 891?alanine (S891A), methionine 918 ?threonine (M918T), alanine 919?proline (A919P) and E768D/A919P) into the short and long isoforms of RET cDNA and transfected the mutant cDNAs into NIH3T3 cells. The transforming activity of the long isoform of Ret with each mutation was much higher that that of its short isoform. Based on the levels of the transforming activity, these mutant RET genes were classi\\u00aeed into two groups; a group with high transforming activity (A883F, M918T and E768D/A919P) and a group with low transforming activity (E768D, V804L, S891A and A919P) (designated high group and low group). Interestingly, the level of transforming activity correlated with clinical phenotypes; high group Ret with the A883F or M918T mutation and low group Ret with the E768D, V804L or S891A mutation were associated with the development of MEN 2B and FMTC, respectively. In addition, we found that substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 905 present in the kinase domain abolished both transforming and autophosphorylation activities of low group Ret whereas it did not a\\u0080ect the activities of high group Ret. Keywords: Ret; tyrosine kinase; MEN 2A; MEN 2B; FMTC Recent studies have established that germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are responsible for development of three dominantly inherited neoplastic disorders including multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (see Pasini et al., 1996 for a review). MEN 2A and MEN 2B share the clinical feature of medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, and FMTC is characterized by the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma alone. Medullary thyroid carcinoma in MEN 2B shows a more aggressive phenotype than that in MEN 2A and FMTC. The MEN 2A and FMTC mutations resulted in nonconservative substitution for six cysteines (cysteines 609, 611, 618, 620, 630 and 634) in the extracellular domain of Ret (Mulligan et al., 1993, 1994; Donis-Keller et al., 1993; Lips et al., 1994; Eng et al., 1996), whereas a point mutation (methionine 918?threonine, M918T) in the tyrosine kinase domain was detected in MEN 2B (Hofstra et al., 1994; Carlson et al., 1994). We and others demonstrated that MEN 2A, MEN 2B and FMTC mutations represent gain-of-function mutations (Santoro et al., 1995; Asai et al., 1995, 1996; Borrelo et al., 1995; Iwashita et al., 1996; Rossel et al., 1997; Carlomagno et al., 1997; Ito et al., 1997). Several other mutations in the kinase domain have recently been identi\\u00aeed in MEN 2A, MEN 2B, FMTC and sporadic MTC patients. Three mutations including glutamic acid 768?aspartic acid (E768D), valine 804?leucine (V804L) and serine 891?alanine (S891A) mutations were detected in FMTC (Eng et al., 1995; Bolino et al., 1995; Hofstra et al., 1997), and an alanine 883?phenylalanine (A883F) mutation in MEN 2B and sporadic MTC (Smith et al., 1997; Gimm et al., 1997). In addition, an E768D/A919P double mutation was found in metastatic lymph nodes from a Japanese female FMTC patient (Miyauchi et al., 1997). Except for Ret with the E768D or V804L mutation (Pasini et al., 1997), there is no information about the mechanism of activation of Ret with newly identi\\u00aeed kinase domain mutations. To understand the molecular mechanisms of its activation by these mutations, we investigated biological and biochemical properties of mutant Ret proteins. As shown in Figure 1, E768 and V804 are located in the kinase domain 1 and A883, S891, M918 and A919 exist in the kinase domain 2. Since it is known that Ret is translated mainly as two isoforms of 1072 (short isoform) and 1114 (long isoform) amino acids that di\\u0080er from each other in the carboxyl-terminal sequence (Figure 1) (Tahira et al., 1990), we introduced these mutations into RET cDNA encoding each isoform and compared the transforming activity of the mutant cDNAs by transfection of NIH3T3 cells. *Correspondence: M Takahashi Received 2 November 1998; revised 3 February 1999; accepted 3 February 1999 Oncogene (1999) 18, 3919 \\u00b1 3922 \\u00e3 1999 Stockton Press All rights reserved 0950 \\u00b1 9232/99 $12.00 http://www.stockton-press.co.uk/onc In addition, the activity of Ret with an E768D/A919P double mutation that was found in metastatic foci of a Japanese female FMTC patient was examined. We previously reported that the transforming activity of the long isoform with the M918T mutation was approximately tenfold higher than that of its short isoform whereas the transforming activity of the long isoform with the MEN 2A (C634R) mutation was 1.5- fold higher than that of its short isoform (Asai et al., 1995, 1996; Iwashita et al., 1996). As observed for Ret with the M918T mutation, the transforming activity of the long isoform with kinase domain mutations examined in this study was much higher (more than \\u00aevefold) than that of their short isoform (Figure 2). In particular, the transforming activity of the short isoform with the E768D, V804L or A919P mutation was almost undetectable (Figure 2). We also found that the transforming activity of the long isoform with the A883F, M918T or E768D/ A919P mutation was 10 \\u00b1 15-fold higher than that of the long isoform of Ret with the E768D, V804L or A919P mutation (Figure 2). The transforming activity of the long isoform with the S891A mutation was about 2 \\u00b1 3-fold higher than that of the long isoform with the E768D, V804L or A919P mutation. Based on the levels of the transforming activity of the long isoform, the mutations detected in the kinase domain were classi\\u00aeed into two groups, a group with high transforming activity (A883F, M918T and E768D/ A919P, designated high group) and a group with low transforming activity (E768D, V804L, S891A and A919P, designated low group) (Figure 2). Interestingly, it turned out that two mutations of high group (A883F and M918T) and three mutations of low group (E768D, V804L and S891A) were associated with the development of MEN 2B and FMTC, respectively. In addition, high transforming activity of Ret with the E768D/A919P mutation found in a Japanese FMTC patient appeared to correlate with malignant progression of tumor cells. Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the Ret protein. SP, signal sequence; CAD, cadherin-like domain; CYS, cysteine-rich region; TM, transmembrane domain; TK, tyrosine kinase domain; aa, amino acids. One cysteine mutation (C634R) in the extracellular domain and six mutations (E768D, V804L, A883F, S891A, M918T and A919P) in the kinase domain analysed in this study are shown. Y905 and Y1062 are tyrosine residues that were replaced with phenylalanine. The short isoform (1072 amino acids) and long isoform (1114 amino acids) di\\u0080er from each other in the carboxyl-terminal sequence. These two isoforms are generated by alternative splicing in the 3' region of the RET gene (Tahira et al., 1990) Figure 2 Transforming activity of the mutant RET genes. A cDNA clone containing the entire coding sequence (for 1072 or 1114 amino acids) of the human RET gene was inserted into the vector containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat. Each mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. Each plasmid DNA (0.1 \\u00b1 0.4 mg) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells (56105 cells in a 60 mmdiameter dish) with 0.04 mg of pSV2neo plasmid DNA and 10 mg of NIH3T3 genomic DNA as described previously (Asai et al., 1995). Transformed foci were scored on day 12 after transfection. Transforming activity of the short (white bars) and long (black bars) isoforms of the designated mutant Ret proteins is shown. Transforming activity of both isoforms of wild type RET was almost undetectable. Two independent experiments were performed for each mutant RET gene Figure 3 Expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant Ret proteins. The transfectants expressing the designated mutant proteins were suspended in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sample bu\\u0080er (20 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 20 mg/ml bromophenol blue) in the presence (reducing) (a, b) or absence (non-reducing) (c) of 80 mM dithiothreitol. The resulting total lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene di\\u00afuoride membranes (Nihon Millipore Kogyo KK, Tokyo, Japan). After anti-Ret antibody (a, c) or antiphosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) (b) was used as the \\u00aerst antibody, the reaction was examined as described previously (Nozaki et al., 1998).

As described previously (Asai et al., 1995; Iwashita et al., 1996; Ito et al., 1997), Ret is expressed as the 155 kDa and 175 kDa proteins that correspond to the immature glycosylated form present in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction and the mature glycosylated form at the plasma membrane, respectively. The patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation of mutant Ret proteins were similar among the established cell lines. The 175 kDa Ret protein with each mutation was more highly phosphorylated than the 155 kDa Ret protein (Figure 3b). Despite the di\\u0080erence of their transforming activity, the reason why the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of each mutant Ret protein was almost equal is currently unclear. Western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions revealed that, unlike Ret with the C634R (MEN 2A) mutation (Asai et al., 1995), the dimer formation of the 175 kDa Ret form with kinase domain mutations was undetectable (Figure 3c). We previously found that tyrosine residues in the kinase domain essential for the transforming activity are di\\u0080erent between Ret with the MEN 2A (C634R) mutation and Ret with the MEN 2B (M918T) mutation. Substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine 905 (Y905F) completely abolished the transforming activity of Ret-MEN2A (C634R) but not Ret-MEN2B (M918T) (Iwashita et al., 1996). This tyrosine is known to be conserved in all tyrosine kinases and play crucial roles in their catalytic and/or biological activities. As shown in Figure 4a, the transforming activity of high group Ret was not a\\u0080ected by replacing tyrosine 905 with phenylalanine (Y905F). Consistent with this observation, tyrosine phosphorylation of high group Ret with the Y905F mutation did not signi\\u00aecantly decrease (Figure 5a and b). In contrast, the transforming activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of low group Ret were abolished by the Y905F mutation (Figures 4b, 5c and d), indicating that this tyrosine residue plays a crucial role in the activities of low group Ret. We also reported that binding of the Shc PTB domain to tyrosine 1062 in the Ret long isoform is important for the transforming activity of Ret with the C634R or M918T mutation (Asai et al., 1996; Lorenzo et al., 1997; Arighi et al., 1997; Durick et al., 1998). As shown in Figure 4, when tyrosine 1062 in Ret with each kinase domain mutation was replaced with phenylalanine, the transforming activity of the mutant proteins markedly decreased, suggesting the importance of the binding of the Shc PTB domain to tyrosine 1062 for their transforming activity. Based on the results of the present study, we propose three di\\u0080erent activation mechanisms of the mutant Ret proteins, leading to the development of MEN 2A, MEN 2B and FMTC. First, cysteine mutations found in the extracellular domain induce ligand-independent Ret dimerization and result in the Figure 4 Transforming activity of the RET genes with mutations of tyrosine residues. Transforming activity of high group Ret (a) or low group Ret (b) with tyrosine mutations is shown by bars. Tyrosine 905 (bar 2) and tyrosine 1062 (bar 3) were replaced with phenylalanine. Bar 1 indicates the transforming activity of Ret without tyrosine mutations. Two independent experiments were performed for each mutant RET gene Figure 5 Expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of Ret with the Y905F mutation. Total cell lysates prepared from the transfectants expressing the designated mutant proteins were separated under reducing conditions and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Ret antibody (a, c) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (b, d). Lane 1 indicates the mutant Ret proteins without tyrosine mutations. Tyrosine 905 was replaced with phenylalanine (lane 2). The 155 kDa and 175 kDa Ret proteins are indicated Characterization of Ret with kinase domain mutations T Iwashita et al 3921 development of MEN 2A or FMTC. Second, three kinase domain mutations (A883F, M918T and E768D/ A919P) confer high transforming activity on Ret without dimerization and are associated with the development of MEN 2B (A883F and M918T) or progression of FMTC (E768D/A919P). In addition, the integrity of tyrosine 905 is not required for the transforming activity and autophosphorylation of Ret with these mutations. Third, Ret with three other kinase domain mutations (E768D, V804L and S891A) has low transforming activity and is associated with the development of FMTC. Tyrosine 905 is a key residue for both transforming activity and autophos-phorylation of these mutant proteins.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
